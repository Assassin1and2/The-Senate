## Quote bot for Discord
---

**Requirements**
- [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - You might have to check "Pre-releases" depending on when you're setting this up.
- [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
  - Use the non-voice option for less headaches, this bot doesn't use voice.

**Setup**
- Install requirements
- Clone or download this repo
- Configure the bot's `config.json`
  - Ignore `db.json`, this is the quote database and will be handled by the bot.
- Start the bot
  - If you're on windows it's probably `python bot.py` in a CMD window of the bot's folder.
  - Otherwise it may be `python3`, `python3.6`, or something else depending on how you installed it.
